# Cycle-Story
### final project hci

## Installation requirements

**NOTE: For the app to work correct we recommend to use Firefox browser on Android devices and Chrome on Iphones**

## Operating instructions

- Open next link in a browser: https://brainwreck6.github.io/Cycle-Story/CycleStory.html
- then in a browser select 3 dots (above or below right corner) and then option add to home screen
- Open the app with the above created shortcut that is now on your home screen

## Any limitations of the implementation

- There is no working cloud-based storage, because of that all of the data is lost after the person leaves the website and closes the tab
- location is faked with WoZ tehnique
- fake starting list of friends
- does not sync with other users
- profile info is hard-coded (although editable)
- achivements are hard-coded (cannot be editable)
